Repository used to store all the files of the teamwork C++ project of the subject of Computing and Networks.

Cada vez que terminemos un avance en el código del trabajo, se sube a este repositorio, a poder ser con un comentario de los cambios y con una versión
nueva en cada subida. (Ejmp: v1.1 , etc. )

La fecha limite de entrega es el 1 de mayo


Acerca de los comentarios finales del PDF:
  "By Monday May 1st, you have to upload, in the forum in the Virtual Campus, a ZIP file with the
.exe file modified to work without valid inputs and a report in PDF explaining the inputs that
disable each stage and the process you have followed to obtain them, including screenshots. In
addition, you must use screenshots to show how you obtained the name of the criminal subgroup.

  Furthermore, you must explain how you modified the code to be able to disable the bomb without
entering the valid inputs. If these explanations are not correct, enough or clear, the points
indicated above for each achievement will be reduced.

  Finally, you must indicate how the work has been divided among team members and how many
hours have each one of them used for the work."

     ASSESSMENT
The grades will be obtained using the score detailed above. The total result will be weighted with a
factor depending on the quality of the code, the writing and the presentation of the report. This
grade can be weighted with another factor depending on the contribution of each student to the
work. There will be a final authorship test after the final submission. Each day late in any of the
phases takes 2 points from the grade.
If the work is carried out using illicit ways, the grade in the continuous assessment for all the
members of the team will be zero.

   GUIDES FOR DEVELOPING THE WORK
   
For developing Phase 1, lab session 1 of unit 0, which introduces the programming language
C/C++, is required.
In the FCR Hacking Force web site you can find a section with resources such as documents and
video tutorials that will help you with the assignment.
